**Multi-Clap Sound Pattern Switch**
**Overview**
The **Multi-Clap Sound Pattern Switch** is a touchless, sound-activated automation system that detects different clap patterns (single, double, and triple claps) to independently control multiple electrical appliances.  
It provides a **simple, low-cost, and efficient smart automation solution** suitable for hands-free environments

**Project Objectives**
- Design a sound-based switching system capable of detecting:
  - Single clap  
  - Double clap    
- Enable independent control of multiple output devices using clap patterns.
- Implement a stable signal amplification circuit using the **LM358 operational amplifier**.
- Create a contactless automation system suitable for:
  - Homes  
  - Classrooms  
 **Components Used**
- Microphone Module  
- LM358 Operational Amplifier  
- 10kPotentiometer  
- Leds    
- Aurdino Uno
- Buzzer

**Working Principle**
1. The microphone captures sound signals generated by claps.
2. Weak audio signals are amplified using the **LM358 op-amp**.
3. The processed signal is analyzed to identify clap patterns.
4. Based on the detected pattern:
   - **Single Clap** → Controls Device 1  
   - **Double Clap** → Controls Device 2  
5. Relays are triggered to switch the corresponding appliances ON or OFF.
